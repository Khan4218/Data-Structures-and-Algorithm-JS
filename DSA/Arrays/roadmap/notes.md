1. Arrays ✅ (Current module)

You’ve done:

Array basics (access, insert, delete, traversal)

Loop-based operations (min, max, sum, duplicates)

Two Pointers (fast–slow, removing duplicates, moving zeros)

You’re learning:

🔜 Sliding Window (variable window, subarray problems)

Prefix sums (bonus concept used in subarray sums)

Once this is complete → we’ll move to Strings

2. Strings 🔜

Reversal, palindrome, anagram

Character frequency

String compression

Sliding window on strings (e.g., longest substring without repeating characters)

3. Hashmaps / Sets

Frequency counting

Hash-based lookups (O(1))

Removing duplicates with Set

Problems like “Two Sum,” “Group Anagrams,” “Majority Element”

4. Linked Lists

Singly / Doubly linked lists

Insertion, deletion, traversal

Slow–fast pointers (detect cycles, middle element)

5. Stacks

Push / Pop / Peek operations

Valid parentheses problem

Monotonic stack (next greater element)

6. Queues

FIFO behavior

Implement using array or linked list

Sliding window maximum

7. Trees

Binary Tree basics (traversal, height, depth)

Binary Search Tree (insert, search)

Level order (BFS), inorder / preorder / postorder (DFS)

8. Graphs

Adjacency list representation

BFS, DFS traversal

Shortest path (BFS)

Topological sorting (DAG)

9. Recursion & Backtracking

Base and recursive cases

Subset generation

Permutations

N-Queens / Sudoku solver

10. Sorting & Searching

Bubble, Selection, Insertion sort

Merge sort (O(n log n))

Quick sort

Binary search variants (first/last position, rotated arrays)

11. Dynamic Programming

Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs

0/1 Knapsack

Longest Common Subsequence

Subset sum / Partition problems

12. Greedy Algorithms

Interval scheduling

Minimum coins / change problems

Huffman coding concept
