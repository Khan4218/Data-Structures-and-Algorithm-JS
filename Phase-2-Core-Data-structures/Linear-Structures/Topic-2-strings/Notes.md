🔤 Phase 2: Strings (Core Data Structure)
📦 What you'll learn:
We'll go step-by-step through:
Accessing characters
Common operations (length, indexing, concatenation)
String traversal
Reversing strings
Counting characters
Palindromes
Time & space analysis for string problems
First up:

✅ Topic: Accessing & Working with Strings
We'll start from scratch — even if you've seen this before — so it’s easy to build advanced string logic later.

🔍 Example:
const word = "hello";
console.log(word[0]); // h
console.log(word.length); // 5

Strings are like arrays of characters.
You can access characters using []
length gives total number of characters.
